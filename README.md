<h4>Tracking:</h4>
To choose how much to increment/decrement by, either click a button to use a preset value or set your own custom value in the input box.
Then, all you need to do is click + or -, depending on what you want to do. Changes are immediately reflected and a graphical representation is given using how muc percent of the goal or limit has been reached. Thats it! No flashy effects or an overwhelmingly and intimidatingly amount of features, just the essentials.
